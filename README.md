# Spectrum

Spectrum is a master server system which can be used for any game but is primarily designed for Unity games.

Spectrum consists of four parts, in various stages of development:

1) SpectrumCore - Master server, handles server registration and matchmaking (as well as optional chat and client authentication).
2) Spectrum Dash - Dashboard for monitoring and modifying the master server list (optional).
3) SpectrumInstance - Instance server (optional), can automatically spawn, manage and kill game server instances on a local machine.
4) SpectrumUnity - Unity adapters for connecting to the master server, both in your gameserver and client (optional).
